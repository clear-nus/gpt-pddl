Output:
Given the instruction to cut some fruits and put them on the plate, the goal in PDDL would focus on having some sliced fruits (in this case, considering the objects identified as "fruits" in the domain such as Apple1, Apple2, etc.) and ensuring they are located on/in the plate receptacle. Assuming that the plate is identified as "Plate1" in the PDDL domain, the goal specification could look as follows:

```lisp
(:goal (and
    (isSliced Apple1)
    (inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1)
    (isSliced Apple2)
    (inReceptacle Apple2 Plate1)
))
```

This goal state declares that Apple1 and Apple2 need to be sliced and then located in/on Plate1. If "Potato1" and "Potato2" are also considered fruits or vegetables that the user wants to include (since sometimes "fruits" can ambiguously include certain vegetables in common parlance), you could extend the goal state to include them as well:

```lisp
(:goal (and
    (isSliced Apple1)
    (inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1)
    (isSliced Apple2)
    (inReceptacle Apple2 Plate1)
    (isSliced Potato1)
    (inReceptacle Potato1 Plate1)
    (isSliced Potato2)
    (inReceptacle Potato2 Plate1)
))
```

This goal accommodates an understanding of "fruits" that includes any sliceable, fruit-like objects mentioned in the domain and places them on the plate after slicing.
