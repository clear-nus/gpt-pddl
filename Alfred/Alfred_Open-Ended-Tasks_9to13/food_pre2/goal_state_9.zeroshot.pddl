Output:
To translate the instruction "Cut some fruits and put them on the plate" into a PDDL goal state, we need to identify the key points:

1. We need fruits that can be considered "cuttable" or "sliceable" which have been mentioned in the ":init" section as those that can be sliced.
2. We need to make sure these sliced fruits are then placed "on the plate".

Assuming "some fruits" refers to any fruits listed as sliceable in the domain, and "the plate" refers to any of the plates mentioned, the goal condition might not specify the exact fruit or plate due to the wording of the instruction. However, for the sake of demonstration and assuming a more specific goal is acceptable, let's set a goal to have the Apple1 and Tomato1 fruits sliced and placed on Plate1.

Given that, the goal state in PDDL can be defined as follows:

```
(:goal (and
        (isSliced Apple1)
        (isSliced Tomato1)
        (objectAtLocation Apple1 Plate1)
        (objectAtLocation Tomato1 Plate1)
      )
)
```

This goal state reflects both key points: the fruits (in this case, Apple1 and Tomato1) are cut (sliced), and they are put on Plate1. Adjust the objects accordingly if the goal needs to be more generalized or to include different fruits or plates.
