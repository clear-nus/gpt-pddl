Output:
Based on the instruction to "Cut some fruits and put them on the plate," we identify two main goals from the instruction given the PDDL domain definition:

1. Ensure that any fruit objects (e.g., Apple1, Apple2) are sliced.
2. Ensure that these sliced fruit objects are placed in a receptacle object identified as Plate1.

Considering the domain definitions and the provided objects, we must create goal conditions that specifically cater to the fruits being sliced and being in or on the Plate1.

Given the provided objects and considering the general goal from the instruction:

```
(:goal
    (and
        (isSliced Apple1)
        (isSliced Apple2)
        (inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1)
        (inReceptacle Apple2 Plate1)
    )
)
```

This goal state specification ensures that:
- The fruits Apple1 and Apple2 have been sliced, as indicated by `(isSliced Apple1)` and `(isSliced Apple2)`.
- The sliced fruits are placed on (in this domain "inReceptacle") the Plate1, as indicated by `(inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1)` and `(inReceptacle Apple2 Plate1)`.

This meets the requirement set out by the instruction to cut some fruits (in this case, apples) and put them on the plate.
