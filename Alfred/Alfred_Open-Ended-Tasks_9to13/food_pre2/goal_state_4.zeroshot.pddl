Output:
To translate the instruction "Cut some fruits and put them on the plate" into a PDDL goal state for the provided domain, we need to identify the components involved based on the given problem definition and domain specification. Since "some fruits" is mentioned without specifying which fruits, we assume it can be any fruit object defined in the problem that is sliceable. Here, "Apple1", "Apple2", and "Tomato1" are sliceable and considered fruits based on the context provided. We also need to acknowledge that these fruits should be sliced (indicated by `(isSliced ?o - object)`) and placed on "Plate1" (indicated by `(inReceptacle ?o - object ?r - receptacle)`). However, because goals in PDDL shouldn't use "not," we won't specify what isn't in the goal state, focusing only on the desired state of affairs.

Here's how we can formulate the goal state based on the instruction:

```lisp
(:goal 
    (and
        ; Assuming at least one of the sliceable fruits is cut and put on the plate.
        (or 
            (and (isSliced Apple1) (inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1))
            (and (isSliced Apple2) (inReceptacle Apple2 Plate1))
            (and (isSliced Tomato1) (inReceptacle Tomato1 Plate1))
        )
    )
)
```

This formulation ensures flexibility in which specific fruit gets cut and placed on the plate, adhering to the "some fruits" part of the instruction. If the intention was to have all sliceable fruits cut and put on the plate, you'd adjust the goal to include all conditions conjunctively inside the `and` block rather than the `or`. However, based on the input, it seems the goal is to have at least one of these actions completed.
