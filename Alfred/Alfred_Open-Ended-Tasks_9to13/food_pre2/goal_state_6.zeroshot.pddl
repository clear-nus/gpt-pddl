Output:
The instruction "Cut some fruits and put them on the plate" implies two main goals under the provided PDDL domain:

1. The fruits (in this case, let's consider "Tomato1", "Tomato2", and "Apple1" as fruits given the domain and problem description) need to be cut. This is represented by their state changing to `(isSliced ?fruit - object)`.

2. These sliced fruits must then be placed on a plate. Assuming we use "Plate1" or "Plate2" as the receptacle for this since these are the available plates in the objects list, we want the state to reflect that these fruits are in the plate, represented by `(inReceptacle ?fruit - object ?plate - receptacle)`.

Therefore, the PDDL goal specification, without utilizing the "not" keyword and considering the objects provided, might look something like this:

```pddl
(:goal (and
        (isSliced Tomato1)
        (isSliced Tomato2)
        (isSliced Apple1)
        (inReceptacle Tomato1 Plate1)
        (inReceptacle Tomato2 Plate1)
        (inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1)
       )
)
```

In this goal specification, I chose "Plate1" as the destination for all sliced fruits; if you wanted to distribute them across multiple plates (like "Plate1" and "Plate2"), you would adjust the `inReceptacle` goals accordingly. Note that based on the PDDL definition and the initial conditions, one would need to adjust actions in a solution plan to first slice these fruits using the appropriate "SliceObject" action before moving them to a plate with the "PutObjectInReceptacle" or similar action.
