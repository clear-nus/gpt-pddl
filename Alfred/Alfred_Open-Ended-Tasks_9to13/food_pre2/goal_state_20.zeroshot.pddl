Output:
Based on your instruction to "cut some fruits and put them on the plate", and given the objects in the PDDL domain file, the closest match to fruits from the provided objects list is "Apple1". Considering the constraints in goal specification, and not using "not" in the formulation, here is how the goal state can be specified in PDDL, under the assumption that Apple1 needs to be cut and then placed on the Plate1:

```lisp
(:goal (and
        (isSliced Apple1)
        (objectAtLocation Apple1 Plate1)
       )
)
```

This goal state reflects that the apple (as an example of fruit mentioned in your instruction) is both cut (which aligns with "cut some fruits") and placed on the plate, meeting the criteria you've outlined.
