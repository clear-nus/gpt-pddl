Output:
Based on the given domain definition and the natural language instruction to "cut some fruits and put them on the plate", the PDDL goal statement can be detailed by identifying the fruits that need to be sliced and placed on a plate. Given the objects and actions in the domain, let's assume that we recognize "Tomato1" and "Apple1" as fruits that are considered for this task. 

To translate this into a PDDL goal, we must specify two conditions for each fruit: (1) the fruit is sliced, and (2) the fruit is in the receptacle "Plate1". However, the domain provided does not explicitly include actions for transferring sliced fruits directly to a plate, so this goal assumes the fruits can somehow end up on "Plate1" after being sliced, consistent with logical steps in the domain (such as slicing the fruit and then putting it in a receptacle).

Here is the corresponding PDDL goal statement fulfilling the requirements:

```
(:goal
    (and
     (isSliced Tomato1)
     (inReceptacle Tomato1 Plate1)
     (isSliced Apple1)
     (inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1)
    )
)
```

This goal asserts that each of the fruits, "Tomato1" and "Apple1," must be both sliced (`isSliced`) and placed in "Plate1" (`inReceptacle`). The assumption here is that the agent carries out actions to slice these fruits and then subsequently performs actions to place them on the plate. The specificity of the fruits, "Tomato1" and "Apple1," comes from the description and interpretation of "cut some fruits" within the capability of the provided domain actions, where `SliceObject` could logically lead to these objectives being met provided the necessary preconditions are satisfied beforehand.
