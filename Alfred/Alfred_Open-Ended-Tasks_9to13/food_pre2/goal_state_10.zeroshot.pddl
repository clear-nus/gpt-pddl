Output:
Based on the natural language instruction to "cut some fruits and put them on the plate", the goal state in PDDL can be formulated as follows. Given the objects listed under types and initial conditions, fruits can include Tomato1, Tomato2, Apple1, and possibly Egg1 and Egg2 based on their categorization (though technically not fruits, they are listed under sliceable and could be mistakenly considered here). Since we are to avoid using "not" in our goal specification and there's no direct way to specify "some" without introducing ambiguity or complexity beyond basic PDDL capabilities, we'll demonstrate a goal that represents sliced versions of these objects being on a plate. The assumption here is to choose identifiable objects that can represent fruits (e.g., Tomato2 and Apple1) for slicing and placing on Plate1, given the domain's limitations.

(:goal 
    (and
        (objectAtLocation Tomato2 Plate1)
        (isSliced Tomato2)
        (objectAtLocation Apple1 Plate1)
        (isSliced Apple1)
    )
)
```
This goal stipulates that Tomato2 and Apple1, which are identified as fruit-like objects, should be both sliced and placed on Plate1. Note, this goal assumes explicit action sequences will slice and move these items to the plate, and it focuses on these two objects to fulfill the "cut some fruits and put them on the plate" instruction within the domain's capabilities and available objects.
