Output:
Based on the provided information and the instruction to "Cut some fruits and put them on the plate," the goal state in PDDL can be specified as follows:

```lisp
(:goal (and
    (isSliced Tomato1)
    (isSliced Apple1)
    (isSliced Apple2)
    (inReceptacle Tomato1 Plate1)
    (inReceptacle Apple1 Plate1)
    (inReceptacle Apple2 Plate1)
))
```

This goal states that the fruits Tomato1, Apple1, and Apple2 should be sliced and then placed on Plate1. Note that while the instruction is to "cut some fruits," for the sake of a clear and demonstrable goal, we have explicitly listed Tomato1, Apple1, and Apple2 as the fruits to be sliced and placed on the plate.
